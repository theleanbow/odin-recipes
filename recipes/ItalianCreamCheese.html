    <h3>This is what she has to say about this recipe</h3>
    <p>
      This is my grandmother's cheesecake recipe passed down to my entire
      family. It's the best. I can't believe I'm sharing it, but everyone needs
      to know how to make an authentic Italian cheesecake. It is creamy and not
      thick, which is why our family LOVES it! For best results, do NOT
      substitute any ingredients with low-fat unless you've made it before and
      want to experiment.
