      fast. They are excellent as leftovers warmed up in the microwave with eggs
      and bacon the next day. They are not a light or low fat dish. Save this
      for a special occasion.

    <h2>Ingredents</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>3 russet potato, peeled and cubed</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>Â½ cup 2% reduced-fat milk</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup grated medium Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x13 inch
        baking pan with butter. Spread potatoes evenly in the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together heavy cream, milk, garlic, flour, salt, and pepper in a
        large bowl. Pour cream mixture over the potatoes. Cover with foil.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then remove the foil.
        Continue baking until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about
        40 minutes. Remove potatoes from the oven and sprinkle Cheddar cheese on
        top. Return to oven and bake until the cheese is melted, 5 to 10
        minutes. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
